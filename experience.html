            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>During my internship at AgileRadioCom, I worked on developing and optimizing Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) schedulers, which are critical for ensuring deterministic communication in industrial and automotive networks.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed scheduling algorithms for time critical data transmission in TSN networks</li>
                <li>Implemented and tested various scheduling policies to optimize network performance</li>
                <li>Analyzed network traffic patterns and latency requirements for different use cases</li>
                <li>Collaborated with the engineering team to integrate schedulers into the existing network stack</li>
                <li>Conducted performance testing and validation of scheduler implementations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Programming Languages</dt>
                <dd>Python</dd>
                
                <dt>Networking Protocols</dt>
                <dd>IEEE 802.1Qbv (Time-Aware Shaping), IEEE 802.1AS (Timing and Synchronization)</dd>
                
                <dt>Tools</dt>
                <dd>Wireshark, Linux, Github</dd>
                
                <dt>Concepts</dt>
                <dd>Real time systems, network scheduling, Quality of Service (QoS), deterministic networking</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>This internship gave me valuable hands on experience with cutting edge networking technology and real time systems. I learned how to balance competing requirements in resource constrained environments and gained a deeper understanding of how modern industrial networks operate. Working with TSN schedulers taught me the importance of precise timing and coordination in distributed systems.</p>
            
            <p>The experience also strengthened my skills in algorithm development, system level programming, and collaborative software development in a professional engineering environment.</p>
