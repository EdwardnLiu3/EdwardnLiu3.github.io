                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Edward Liu</strong>, and I'm a Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm passionate about both <em>software development</em> and <em>hardware design</em>, with experience in full-stack web applications, embedded systems, and digital design.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoy working on projects that combine my interests in algorithms, system architecture, and practical problem-solving. Whether it's building a multiplayer web game or designing a pipelined processor, I love the challenge of creating efficient and functional systems.</p>
                
                <p>This website showcases my projects, work experience, and personal interests. Feel free to explore and learn more about what I do!</p>
